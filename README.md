# L3_UE_Tutorial

This is an experimental project in Unreal Engine 5 that is based on [Luke Elrod](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeElrod){:target="_blank"}'s video tutorials and goes a little beyond. The item database is populated by an external file during runtime whenever the game starts or restarts.

Edit the file located in _{Game Directory}/L3/Content/Data/L3_ItemDB.json_ to spawn those items in the game's world. For that purpose I also developed another tool that makes the item creation process easier ([L3_ItemCreator](https://github.com/Raynesz/L3_ItemCreator){:target="_blank"}).
